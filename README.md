# doom-setup

This repo contains configs and a setup script for starting clojure development in doom emacs from scratch on a mac.
The setup script can be run with
```
$ sudo /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wilbrt/doom-setup/refs/heads/main/setup.sh)"
```
It most of what one could need, starting with homebrew.
